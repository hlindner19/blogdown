The trip that started it all... I had no intentions of traveling to Hawaii. I was trying to get to Canada to go on a fishing trip. After my flights fell a part, I wasn't going to be able to make it in time to meet up with my family to get to Canada. I didn't take vacation days for nothing... so I switched my flight to Honolulu during my layover. The only downside: the type of things you pack for Canada versus Hawai'i are very different.

[Seaside Hawaiian Hostel](http://seasidehawaiianhostel.com/) resides in the heart of Waikiki, only an 8 minute walk to Waikiki beach. The 19 or 20 bus (departing from the upper level of the airport) will take you nearly to the doorstep of the hostel.  
**The good:** Staff provided cheap breakfast options like pastries and muffins. The outdoor space is equipped with a hot tub, shower/hose for rinsing sand off, and a spot to watch movies. Lockers available within the dorms (BYO lock, of course) and laundry is available for a fee. Biggest advantage is the central location to the beach, shops and restaurants.  
**The not so good:** Everyone I know who has stayed here agrees that it is rather loud at night, in both the common areas and dorms. Ants galore; They're not playing when they say not to bring any food in the dorms. The overall vibe was okay-not the friendliest of places I have stayed.     
**Price:** $32/night for a 6-bed coed dorm

#### How to get around

Seeing as I hadn't planned on taking a vacation, my budget was rather limited. To cut costs, I avoided renting a car and utilized the local bus system, Uber/Lyft, and mooched rides from other hostel mates.
