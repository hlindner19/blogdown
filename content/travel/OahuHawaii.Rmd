The trip that started them all. I had zero intentions of traveling to Hawaii. My goal was to get to Canada for a fishing trip, but after my flights fell a part I wasn't going to be able to make it in time to meet up with my family to catch my ride to Canada. I didn't take vacation days for nothing... so I switched my flight to Honolulu during my layover. The only downside: the type of things you pack for Canada versus Hawai'i are very different.

[Seaside Hawaiian Hostel](http://seasidehawaiianhostel.com/) resides in the heart of Waikiki, only an 8 minute walk to Waikiki beach. The 19 or 20 bus (departing from the upper level of the airport) will take you nearly to the doorstep of the hostel.  
**The good:** Staff provided cheap breakfast options like pastries and muffins. The outdoor space is equipped with a hot tub, shower/hose for rinsing off, and a spot to watch movies. Lockers are available within the dorms (BYO lock, of course) and laundry is available for a fee. The biggest advantage is the central location to beaches, shops and restaurants.  
**The not so good:** Everyone I know who has stayed here agrees that it is rather loud at night, in both the common areas and dorms. Ants galore; they're not playing when they say not to bring any food in the dorms. The overall vibe was mediocre-not the friendliest of places I have stayed.     
**Price:** $32/night for a 6-bed coed dorm

Seeing as I hadn't planned on taking a vacation, my budget was rather limited. To cut costs, I avoided renting a car and utilized the local bus system, Uber/Lyft, and took up offers from other hostel dwellers to go exploring. Coming from a city where the bus system is semi-functional on a good day, Oahu's ['TheBus'](http://thebus.org) was a real treat. You can download their app, DaBus2, for real-time tracking. Route 22 will take you to several tourist hotspots including Diamond Head, Hanauma Bay and Koko Crater. Reach the North Shore via the 52 and get between Waikiki and HNL airport on route 19 or 20. You can nearly circumnavigate the island using the bus system. One-way fare is $2.75.

**Diamond Head Hike:** Undoubtedly the most popular hike in the area, the historic Diamond Head State Monument hike is roughly a 2 mile (3.2 km) roundtrip hike only 3 miles away from the hostel (can take bus route 2 or 23 + 15 min walk). It'll take you up a series of steep switchbacks and staircases to the old fire control station, providing great views of the surrounding Waikiki area. I recommend arriving very early as there's always a crowd and because there is very little shade on the trail. (Like so crowded the trail looks like an ant farm from afar). Be prepared to pay the entrance fee (cash only) of \$1 as a walk-in or \$5 to drive in. Bring a few extra dollars for fresh pineapple on your way out!

**Manoa Falls Hike:**  Manoa Falls is a wildly different hike compared to Diamond Head, given it's in the rain forest. It's relatively short, only 1.6 miles (2.5 km) to the 150 foot waterfall (which I recommend taking a dip in when you arrive - it's refreshingly cold). I opted to go on a guided hike here though [Hiking Hawaii](hikinghawaii808.com), mostly for the convience of the included transportation. The added bonus was that I had a cool, knowledgeable local to teach me things I wouldn't otherwise have known. The guide groups are small, no more than 7 hikers and offer the opportunity to meet other people. Hiking Hawaii also has a really hip cafe in Waikiki to swing by for a bite to eat. The trail itself is quite muddy, so reasonable footwear is important.

**Koko Crater Hike:**  Koko Crater is a very popular, real life StairMaster and not for the faint of heart! The 1.8 mile (2.9 km) out-and-back takes you up 1,050 stairs, which are actually old and decrepit railroad ties that were used to get supplies up to the peak for the military bunkers that were built during WWII. Sturdy footwear is essential as there are some pretty sketchy areas, including a bridge of railroad ties with a 40 foot drop underneath. Rest often and step off to the side to let other hikers pass you. If you love leg day, this is your hike. Take the 22 bus from Waikiki and get off at Kalanianaole Hwy + Hanauma Bay Rd. (Also go down to Hanauma Bay across the street afterwards for some relaxing beach bumming and snorkeling).

**Cruise the Island:** To really get a feel for Oahu, find yourself a car or someone who has a car and start driving the coast. There are plenty of scenic stops along the way to make an entire day out of it, whether you travel to the west most point of the island or head up the North Shore. Chat with the locals along the way and let them guide you to hole in the wall stops along the way too. (This is how Aloha Poke was discovered). Electric beach is a fun stop for snorkeling if going west, but note that the current can be strong here. Also if going west, drive to where the road ends and make the two-mile hike to Kaena point and watch the sunset from the westward most point of the island.

**Magic Island:** If Waikiki beach is a bit too crowded for your taste, hop on the 8, 19, or 42 bus and cruise over to Magic Island Lagoon. If you're as lucky as I was, you'll have the whole place basically to yourself! There's a nice park behing the lagoon too.

**Aloha Poke:**  A hole in the wall type place in Waianae, [Aloha Poke](https://www.facebook.com/AlohaPoke1/) will fulfill your fresh fish dreams and let you experience the local cuisine. Parking is sparce but don't let that deter you, this place gets rave reviews!

**Island Vintage Shave Ice:** This popular spot located at the Royal Hawaiian Center next to Waikiki Beach has the best shave ice I have encountered. It's made with natural ingrediants rather than syrups and is garnished with fresh fruits, popping boba, and mochi. The line is always long but definitely worth the wait after a day in the sun.
