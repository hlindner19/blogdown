The trip that started them all. I had zero intentions of traveling to Hawaii. My goal was to get to Canada for a fishing trip, but after my flights fell a part I wasn't going to be able to make it in time to meet up with my family to catch my ride to Canada. I didn't take vacation days for nothing... so I switched my flight to Honolulu during my layover. The only downside: the type of things you pack for Canada versus Hawai'i are very different.

[Seaside Hawaiian Hostel](http://seasidehawaiianhostel.com/) resides in the heart of Waikiki, only an 8 minute walk to Waikiki beach. The 19 or 20 bus (departing from the upper level of the airport) will take you nearly to the doorstep of the hostel.  
**The good:** Staff provided cheap breakfast options like pastries and muffins. The outdoor space is equipped with a hot tub, shower/hose for rinsing off, and a spot to watch movies. Lockers are available within the dorms (BYO lock, of course) and laundry is available for a fee. The biggest advantage is the central location to beaches, shops and restaurants.  
**The not so good:** Everyone I know who has stayed here agrees that it is rather loud at night, in both the common areas and dorms. Ants galore; They're not playing when they say not to bring any food in the dorms. The overall vibe was mediocre-not the friendliest of places I have stayed.     
**Price:** $32/night for a 6-bed coed dorm

Seeing as I hadn't planned on taking a vacation, my budget was rather limited. To cut costs, I avoided renting a car and utilized the local bus system, Uber/Lyft, and took up offers from other hostel dwellers to go exploring. Coming from a city where the bus system is semi-functional on a good day, Oahu's ['TheBus'](http://thebus.org) was a real treat. You can download their app, DaBus2, for real-time tracking. Route 22 will take you to several tourist hotspots including Diamond Head, Hanauma Bay and Koko Crater. Reach the North Shore via the 52 and get between Waikiki and HNL airport on route 19 or 20. In summary, you can nearly circumnavigate the island using the bus system. One-way fare is $2.75.
