<p>Every time I’ve connected through the SeaTac airport I get a little salty about not being able to stay a while. Seattle had been a natural choice destination for about a year since the area underscores things I seek regularly: nature and sustainable living - plus it has the added benefits of a large city. I envy the residents for having the convenience of urban living at their doorsteps and world-class views in their backyards. If it weren’t for the less than favorable weather, I would be damn near sold for life.</p>

<p>Want a place with character? <a href="https://www.hostelseattle.com/city_hostel_seattle">City Hostel Seattle</a> will fit the bill. A renovated 1920s hotel, each dorm room was designed and painted by a local artist. To get here from the SeaTac airport, take the <a href="https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/popular-destinations/sea-tac-airport">Link Light Rail</a> by following the signage from baggage claim. Fare works on a distance-based system and is $3 from SeaTac to Westlake Station, leaving you with a 10 minute walk to the hostel. Alternatively, get off at University Street Station and transfer to the 5, 17, 24 or 26 bus for $2.50 more. Commute takes about an hour.<br />
<strong>Highlights:</strong> The hostel is located in the heart of the city within sight of the Space Needle, making any downtown excursion easily accessible. There were vast amounts of common space for socializing including a dining area, lounge space, and movie theater. The restrooms are plentiful and detached from the dorms, making things quieter at night. Security is a top priority here; each guest is required to keep their key card on them at all times to access their dorm, and the building (staff checks each person has a key card when entering). Finally, there is delicious free breakfast everyday (with vegan options!).<br />
<strong>Downsides:</strong> I would have liked to see the hostel host some social events given all the space they have. There is no dedicated parking for the hostel, which is only a potential problem if you’re renting a car.<br />
<strong>Price:</strong> $35/night for a 6 bed mixed dorm.</p>

</center>
<p>Seattle has supreme public transit which includes the rail system, bus system, street cars and monorail. Like any big city, Uber and Lyft work great too. I didn’t use any of them much as I preferred to walk to get a better feel for the city. Importantly, I felt safe walking around the city alone, both during the day and night. It’s easy to navigate and super clean compared to Philly.<br />
<br> I spent one day outside the city and turned to Turo to rent a car for the day. If you’re not familiar with Turo, it is basically Airbnb for cars and can be a convenient and affordable option with a little planning. Even booking a day prior, I got a reasonably priced car for the day but I did have to go a bit out of my way to pick it up. Get a $25 credit by signing up <a href="https://turo.com/c/hannal16">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Space Needle:</strong> Did you really go to Seattle if you didn’t go to the <a href="https://www.spaceneedle.com/">Space Needle</a>? If you are willing to brave the mass amounts of tourists, the viewing platform gives a great lay of the land. The rotating floor is a neat feature too in addition to all the recent renovations. A ticket up will run you a whopping $32.50 (minimum).</p>

<p><strong>Mount Rainier National Park:</strong> Lowkey the real reason I wanted to go to Seattle, I’ve been eyeing Rainier for years. I was pushing my luck trying to hike with winter slated to show up at any moment, and that it did. Originally I planned to hike the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/summer-land-trail">Summer Land Trail</a> on the east side of the mountain, but the road to the trail closed due to a snowstorm that moved through the day prior. Instead, I opted for the 5.5 mile (8.9 km) out-and-back <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/tolmie-peak-trail--2">Tolmie Peak Trail</a> on the west side, which is park of the iconic Wonderland Trail. The drive from Seattle is a little over two hours, with the worst portion of the drive being the last few miles up a gravel road, riddled with pot holes so gnarly it makes Philly’s roads look pristine. Make sure to stop at the pay box after entering the park to buy a park pass for $30, there were several rangers at the trail head checking cars.<br />
<br> The hike itself is captures everything I imagine when I think of the Pacific Northwest: lush, damp vegetation, towering trees and earthy crisp air. While the trail head was full with cars, I surprisingly encountered few people on the trail, adding to the serenity. Before reaching the peak, you hit Eunice Lake and that’s where the real hike starts. The last mile has the fastest elevation gain, up to Tolmie lookout (an old fire lookout tower). Conditions were cloudy when I arrived, and Mount Rainier played hide-and-seek the entire time, though that didn’t keep me from staying up there for as long as possible. I recommend dressing in layers, as it’s a bit chilly above the clouds.</p>

<p><strong>Amazon:</strong> The first thing I did when I arrived in Seattle, even before checking into the hostel, was stopping by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16008589011">Amazon Go</a>, a ‘grab and go’ small scale grocery store. Swipe into the store with the Amazon Go app on your way in, and each time you put something into your bag, it will be added to your cart. Walk through the exit and you’ll be charged for whatever is in your bag. They don’t sell anything novel, but it’s the way they sell it, and it’s no doubt the future of shopping. While you cannot go inside unless you are an employee, you should also walk by the Amazon Spheres to see the unique architecture.</p>
