<p>The trip that started it all… I had no intentions of traveling to Hawaii. I was trying to get to Canada to go on a fishing trip. After my flights fell a part, I wasn’t going to be able to make it in time to meet up with my family to get to Canada. I didn’t take vacation days for nothing… so I switched my flight to Honolulu during my layover. The only downside: the type of things you pack for Canada versus Hawai’i are very different.</p>

<h4>How to get around</h4>
<p>Seeing as I hadn’t planned on taking a vacation, my budget was rather limited. To cut costs, I avoided renting a car and utilized the local bus system, Uber/Lyft, and mooched rides from other hostel mates.</p>
