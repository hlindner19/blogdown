<p>One day I saw a picture of Banff and I thought it was really beautiful, so I googled whether there were any hostels in Banff, and if they have a public transit system. Both were a yes and the trip was born in under 10 minutes. Winter in Banff is truly the most magical and cozy winter wonderland-esque destination I could ever imagine. You definitely do <em>not</em> need to be a big-time skier or snowboarder to have a most enjoyable time here. However one thing you do absolutely need is adequate winter gear… Banff winter makes a Minnesota winter look like chum.</p>

<p><a href="www.banfinternationalhostel.com">Banff International Hostel</a> has been one of my favorite hostels to date. Overall, it is well-run, clean and has a great crew of people (staff and guests alike). See below for how to get here from Calgary International Airport.<br />
<strong>Highlights:</strong> Each dorm has lockers, an en suite bathroom, reading lights at each bed, and a fridge. The front desk is open 24 hours/day and has an ATM - super convenient for the non-Canadians. The Banff Avenue Liquor Store is located within the hostel if that’s your jam. If you are skiing/snowboarding, there is storage at the hostel and the shuttle to Sunshine stops in front of the hostel. Most importantly, there is free delicious wholesome breakfast everyday!<br />
<strong>Downsides:</strong> Their online booking system does not accept Visa debit which may be problematic for some. Otherwise, I’m hard-pressed to think of any cons.<br />
<strong>Price:</strong> $30.90/night (USD) for a 6-8 bed mixed dorm.</p>

<p><strong>Calgary -&gt; Banff:</strong> Getting from Calgary to Banff (takes about an hour and a half) isn’t very complicated or expensive. I opted to take the <a href="https://banffairporter.com/rates/">Banff Airporter</a> directly from the airport into Banff. The one-way ticket cost ~$50 USD (plus driver tip) and is well-worth the convenience (IMO) because you don’t have to leave the Calgary airport once you arrive, you get dropped off wherever you are staying in Banff, and it’s a comfortable ride.<br />
<strong>Around Banff:</strong> It is ridiculously easy to get around town and to all the major destinations like Sulphur Mountain, Tunnel Mountain and Lake Louise using the <a href="http://banff.ca/index.aspx?NID=435">Roam bus system</a>. You can track the buses in real time on <a href="http://banff.ca/index.aspx?NID=435">their website</a>. One-way fare is $2, or buy a day pass for $5. The buses accept USD and CAD but only offer change vouchers, so exact change is preferred. The ‘downtown’ area itself is also small enough that it’s reasonable to walk most places, which let’s you soak in the views too.<br />
<strong>Banff -&gt; Calgary:</strong> Unfortunately, the return trip is not as budget friendly to take Banff Airporter again (~$100). An alternative option I found was to take a Greyhound bus from Banff into Calgary, and then take an Uber from downtown Calgary to the airport. (I paid $26 for the bus, but this pricing varies). The Greyhouse station in Banff is centrally located and within walking distance from the hostel (roughly 15 minutes). Sadly, Greyhound is canceling all services in Canada at the end of October this year.</p>
