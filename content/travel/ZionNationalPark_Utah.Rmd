Camp! Zion has three [campgrounds](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/campgrounds-in-zion.htm) that are open March-November: Watchman, South, and Lava Point. I stayed at Watchman. If you plan to camp, you should make a reservation online as soon as reservations open up as they go fast.  
**Highlights:**  Watchman and South are adjacently located next to the South Entrance which means you have immediate access to [Zion Outfitter](https://www.zionoutfitter.com), (clothing, equipment rental, and SHOWERS!/laundry), the Zion Canyon Visitor Center, Brew Pub, a small grocery/supply story, and a gift store. (Talk about luxurious camping options). The campsites also have fully functioning restrooms, potable water, and trash dumpsters. The star gazing at night from camp is spectacular.  
**Downsides:** Cell phone reception is too good here.  
**Price:** Tent-only campsites are $20/night.

**HOW TO GET AROUND**
</font>
</center>

A rental car here is a necessity (mostly to get to the park, and to get around during the off-season). If you are visiting during the busy season (March - November), you cannot drive through the canyon on Zion Canyon Scenic Dive, you must use the [free park shuttle](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/shuttle-system.htm) which leaves from Zion Canyon Visitor Center and stops at every trail along the route. Upon entering the park, you have to purchase a park pass if you don't have an annual for \$35, valid for seven days.

Literally anything you can cook on a fire, including pizza with dried pineapple, because pineapple *always* goes on pizza.
