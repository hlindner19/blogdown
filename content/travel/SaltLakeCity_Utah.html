<p>Salt Lake City was the final stop on what turned into the #summerofviews, and it did not disappoint! This city has a lively downtown area and quick access to outdoor adventure on every level.</p>

<p>Of the few hostels in the SLC area, none of them seem to have their act together. Cue Airbnb.<br />
I stayed in this lovely <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1273173">downtown loft</a> and split the cost with another person, so it wasnâ€™t a great deal more than a hostel would have been. If you can book far enough in advance, Airbnb is an affordable and convienent option to take advantage of, and you still get the benefit of having a local (your host) for the inside scoop on the best places to hit.</p>
