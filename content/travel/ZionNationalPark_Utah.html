<p>Camp! Zion has three <a href="https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/campgrounds-in-zion.htm">campgrounds</a> that are open March-November: Watchman, South, and Lava Point. I stayed at Watchman. If you plan to camp, you should make a reservation online as soon as reservations open up as they go fast.<br />
<strong>Highlights:</strong> Watchman and South are adjacently located next to the South Entrance which means you have immediate access to <a href="https://www.zionoutfitter.com">Zion Outfitter</a>, (clothing, equipment rental, and SHOWERS!/laundry), the Zion Canyon Visitor Center, Brew Pub, a small grocery/supply story, and a gift store. (Talk about luxurious camping options). The campsites also have fully functioning restrooms, potable water, and trash dumpsters. The star gazing at night from camp is spectacular.<br />
<strong>Downsides:</strong> Cell phone reception is too good here.<br />
<strong>Price:</strong> Tent-only campsites are $20/night.</p>

<font size="5"> <strong>HOW TO GET AROUND</strong> </font>
</center>
<p>A rental car here is a necessity (mostly to get to the park, and to get around during the off-season). If you are visiting during the busy season (March - November), you cannot drive through the canyon on Zion Canyon Scenic Dive, you must use the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/shuttle-system.htm">free park shuttle</a> which leaves from Zion Canyon Visitor Center and stops at every trail along the route. Upon entering the park, you have to purchase a park pass if you don’t have an annual for $35, valid for seven days.</p>

<p>Literally anything you can cook on a fire, including pizza with dried pineapple, because pineapple <em>always</em> goes on pizza.</p>
