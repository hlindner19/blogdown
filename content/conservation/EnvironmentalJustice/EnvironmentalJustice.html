<p>Early November I attended the Students for Zero Waste (SZW) 2018 Conference. Naturally, I expected to learn about waste, but I left with an entirely new perspective on the environmental and climate crises we face.</p>
<p>When we think about making changes to our lifestyles for the benefit of the environment, we tend to only think of ourselves and how our modification or change will affect our lifestyle. It’s not often that we make a change on behalf of other people. What am I getting at here? The reality is, a white, middle-class person living in Philadelphia like me, doesn’t experience even a fraction of the negative effects of climate change compared to other people. So often its the impovershed, the minorities, the poor, the under represented, the indigenous, the oppressed… that are left to deal with the impacts of our environmental disaster. It’s for this sole reason that any sort of climate or environmental initiative needs to also be an environemntal justice (EJ)/climate justice (CJ) initiative. These marginalized people have been fighting hard, but their voices tend to fall on deaf ears. The system doesn’t work for them. In fact, it’s not a stretch at all to say it works against them. Therefore, when I or anyone else decides to make lifestyle changes, or tries to push policy, it’s crucial that we align ourselves with these communities to find out how the system needs to change for them, because it’s a crock of shit if we change the system in a way that continues to not work for them. How can we conduct ourselves in a way that also helps them. The system hasn’t worked for them for so damn long.</p>
<p>Here’s two examples:</p>
<p>The keynote speaker for SZN was grassroots activist, Melissa Miles who lives in the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey. The Ironbound is an environmental justice community, as the location experiences heavy amounts of pollution due to industrial factories, a massive garbage incinerator, and being home to a former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange">Agent Orange</a> dioxin factory. Another important characteristic of the Ironbound is that it is a multi-ethnic, largely working-class community, where 1 out of every 4 residents live in poverty.<br />
Melissa’s keynote focused on the negative impacts of the incinerator that operates in her community, and highlighted how it’s an exceptional example of the broken system. First, we need to recognize the function of an incinerator. Waste that does not go to landfull may be taken to an incinerator where it is burned to ash, and flue gas and heat are expelled. Let’s be clear. Burning trash does <em>not</em> make it disappear entirely. What it does do, is relase particulate matter and other toxins into the atmosphere that are inhaled day in and day out by the Ironbound residents, resulting in increased respitory-related illnesses and diseases. It also destroys goods that someone deemed to be waste, but could have otherwise been a resource mined for reuse.<br />
Incinerators need massive amounts of waste to churn a profit and continue operating. Thus, operators and those investing in incinerators (which are extremely costly to build and maintain) are inherently condoning and encouraging greater amounts of consumption (i.e. capitalism) resulting in more waste, despite the harmful effects it has downstream on: 1. the resident communities where incinerators operate and 2. the environment as a whole. <strong>Historically, incinerators have been placed in <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/11/115008#erl521204s2">low-income neighborhoods of color</a>, leaving already vulnerable communities to bear the burden of everybody else’s waste.</strong></p>

<p>These two examples that highlight the drivers of environmental <em>in</em>justice: capitalism and colonialism. Who and how are you going to align yourself with so that you do not become a part of the historical systematic oppression?</p>
