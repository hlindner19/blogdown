<p>A few days into July I caught wind of the ‘Plastic Free July’ movement on Facebook. I’m always eager to partake in anything that contributes to a more sustainable lifestyle, especially if it also serves to educate myself on the larger climate narrative.</p>

TL;DR: it was <em>H A R D</em>.

<p>First, a bit on the movement and organization behind it. Plastic Free July (PFJ) was born from the West-Austalian based non-profit organization Plastic Free Foundation in 2017. Their aim is conceptually simple: a world that is free from plastic waste. For three years now their campaign has encouraged global citizens to move away from plastic waste in any of a variety of ways throughout the month of July (and hopefully beyond) including avoiding single-use plastic packaging, eliminating takeaway items (bags, bottles, straws, cups), and even transitioning to living plastic-free entirely.</p>
<p>The campaign seems to be having a measurable impact. Their website estimates that last year 120+ million worldwide participants saved 490 million kilograms of plastic waste. This year, they tallied 230 million participants. All of this doesn’t mean much though if you don’t understand the lifecycle of plastic and how it plays into the larger climate problem. Most often it seems we think about the harms of plastic post-consumer: as litter, as mounds of trash in places far away, and as objects getting lodged in sea turtles noses. But plastic, being rooted in oil, is a nuisance to our planet from the beginning. Like many things we absent-mindedly consume, plastic begins as crude oil. An oil refinery separates the crude oil into different components that differ in their structure of carbon and hydrogen. Naphtha is of particular importance for plastic production. Then, depending on the catalyst used, different processes are used to create different types of plastic.</p>
<p>By now, anyone with access to current media has caught at least one of the bombshell climate science reports. The global reliance on and burning of fossil fuels is hurtling humanity towards an extremely grim future due to greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, we continue business as usual, consuming more than we ever have before - often in the form of plastic, which again, begins with oil. Tangentially related, oil majors have spent millions on psychologial warfare campaigns to make you believe that we cannot live without oil, and it is up to the individual - not the institutions - to make changes that support a sustainable future. But this is a different conversation!</p>
<p>The other end of the cycle is destructive too. Our waste management strategies are atrocious, especially in first world countries. More often than not, our waste is shipped to far off lands that are left to deal with our overconsumption. What little we keep has an extremely low reuse rate. For example in Philadelphia during the former half of 2019, the city wasn’t even attempting to recycle half of the recyclables it collected. The city’s recycling contract with China had expired, and was not immediately renewed due to a major price increases. Then, consider that for something to actually be recycled, it has to BE a recyclable, and meet a contamination standard. I’d bet my bottom dollar that most people aren’t reading their city’s guidelines on what qualifies, and how clean it has to be. For context, modern recycling facilities in China are adopting a 0.5% contamination standard while Philadelphia’s is between 15% and 18%. So yeah… you do need to rinse that shampoo bottle and scrape all the peanut butter out of that. What isn’t recycled is sent to landfill, incinerated, or ends up in those plastic cities you see photographed in National Geographic magazines.</p>

<p>Back to Plastic Free July! I wanted to share my experience and some of the insights I gained throughout the month. My goal for the month was to avoid single use plastics as an active consumer. In other words, if I already had a plastic wrapped granola bar at home, I could eat it, but I couldn’t purchase the equivalent elsewhere.</p>
<p>Upon my first grocery run I received a slap in the face wake up call as to how difficult this would be. It didn’t help that I had absent-mindedly forgotten by produce bags and bulk bin bags. Some examples of things I had to cope with: - Switching to bakery bread because it came in a paper bag, rather than a plastic bag. Fine and well, except I had to sacrifice my usual bread that I depend on for a significant portion of my daily whole grains and protein! (I’m looking at you, Silver Hills hemp bread &lt;3) - No more tortilla chips, or pasta because every single paper-based option also included a plastic window. Apparently we must also display the food inside so consumers know that there is in fact tortilla chips inside the bag. - Switching kombucha brands to one that doesn’t use a plastic cap.</p>

<p>A large and naively unanticipated by-product of this challenge was that I effectively eliminated all processed foods from my diet. I was generally left buying naked, raw foods. Being vegan I was somewhat accustomed to this already, but PFJ really turned things up a notch. Not surprisingly, I spent a lot more time planning meals and cooking in July compared to other months. Down the line, this resulted in having a nearly empty trash and recycling each week (though a definite increase in compost). I loved this tangible result!</p>
<p>My plastic free month was certainly riddled with ‘fails’ or, more aptly, learning experiences. In one instance I stopped into good ole’ McD’s for a slushie on a hotter than hell day. Anticipating it would come in a plastic cup, I planned to ask for a paper cup and no lid. But after paying the cashier walked away so fast I didn’t get to ask, and I ended up with a plastic cup, and lid. On another occasion, I ordered tea from Caribou and requested no lid - only to learn that it’s against policy for workers to hand over a hot drink without a lid.</p>
<p>Other times I wasn’t able to anticipate and mitigate my need for a plastic-based product. During the middle of the month I got sick, and desperately wanted green juice and vitamins, both of which resulted in single-use plastic purchases. I also failed to account for internal packaging with an Amazon purchase, and was left with a plastic mailer and plastic pillows. After dining out on one occasion I received a styrofoam take out container, rather than a paper-based one.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult obstacles was trying to keep up with the challenge while traveling. The final week of July I was in Denver for a conference and stayed in a hostel where I planned to cook most of my meals. This of course, required grocery shopping. With the conference, I didn’t have the time throughout the week to properly plan and cook meals so despite my best efforts, convenience reigned king and plastic-packaged products were purchased.</p>
<p>My favorite interaction incurred through this challenge was at an ice cream shop in Denver. The shop used small metal spoons for their samples, which I thought was pretty cool, but had regular plastic spoons at checkout. I requested one of the tiny sample spoons to eat my ice cream and would return it after finishing. The cashier looked at me like I was crazy, but to my satisfaction she obliged.</p>
<p>Despite the multitude of fails, the month was no doubt a success as I have a much deeper understanding of my reliance on plastics. I was able to identify changes I can incorporate for the long term and companies I can support that have also made it their mission to avoid single-use plastics. I, and I think most of the world, is unfortunately not ready to live entirely plastic free. In fact, it’s probably going to be a long and hard battle to even come close. I continue to avidly support the mission and will participate yearly, but I’m also not waiting around for Oreo’s to come in a non-plastic package.</p>
