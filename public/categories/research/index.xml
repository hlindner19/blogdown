The Paris climate agreement set a clear goalâ€”to reduce carbon emissions to near zero as quickly as possible. However, the most efficient, effective, and economical methods of reaching that goal are still uncertain.</description>

      <description>Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a procedure performed for melanoma patients to check whether their melanoma has spread beyond their original tumor site. This information is used for determining an appropriate treatment plan and predicting long term outcomes for patients. However, there are subsets of patients who do not undergo SLNB for a variety reasons: the tumor is considered thin, the patient is elderly, the melanoma is already late stage, or the patient simply elects to not have the procedure.</description>

      <description>In this brief descriptive analysis, I use data from the Pacific Islands Ocean Observing System (PacIOOS) to characterize tagged Tiger Sharks that roam the Pacific Hawaiian waters, specifically around the islands of Maui and Oahu. The dataset contains 46 different tagged sharks, spanning 7036 observations which represent the number of times the 46 tags registered with 27 acoustic receivers around placed around the islands.</description>
