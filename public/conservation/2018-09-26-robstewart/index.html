            <p>Growing up in a land-locked area, I had little exposure to the ocean and the creatures that call it home. So it was a bit unusual that I developed a deep-seeded love for the predator of the seas - sharks. The moment I looked past their media-driven reputation as ruthless killers, I discovered their worth. Having evolved over 400 million years ago, and surviving the last five mass extinctions, it’s no wonder these animals are amazing super-predators, shaping all oceanic life and ecosystems since their arrival.</p>
<p>In 2016 I stumbled upon a documentary on YouTube, called Sharkwater. Produced by Rob Stewart of Toronto Canada, it was an exposé on the shark fin industry. Over the years I had gotten the impression that sharks weren’t well respected. People treat sharks in ways that would ignite public outcry if the same actions were taken upon any land-dwelling animal, all in the name of fear and greed. But the scope of the problem was far beyond anything I had unearthed previously. Over 100 million sharks were being killed each year for the billion-dollar industry of shark fin soup (a Chinese delicacy), leading to a 90+% decline in shark populations. The impact of this on ocean ecosystems is nauseating. I redoubled my efforts to be a champion and spokesperson for sharks.</p>

<p>Fast forward to September of this year, Sharkwater Extinction, the followup movie to Sharkwater, was slated to make its worldwide premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Sharks had become so deeply ingrained in my life at this point that there was no way I was going to miss this film. What I learned this time shook me to my core. Despite ten years of progress since the initial release of Sharkwater and a near worldwide ban on shark finning, the number of sharks murdered each year is currently estimated to be upwards of 150 million. If our society isn’t as interested in the shark fin industry anymore, why has the slaughter continued? Policy loopholes, black markets, mafias, corrupt companies, more fear and more greed. The ban on shark finning means that fisherman are not allowed to land a shark, cut off its fins, and throw the body back leaving it to drown. Thus to avoid breaking law, fisherman now land sharks and bring the entire body back to port. This begs the question, what’s happening to the 80 million shark bodies not attributed to shark fin soup, and why has nobody taken notice? Spoiler alert: they’re being used in pet food, fertilizers, livestock feed, and cosmetics. Renamed and fed to us in fast food, and sold under names such as ‘flake’, ‘rock salmon’, and ‘whitefish’.</p>

<p>I returned home to Philadelphia and I didn’t know what to do. I spoke to my friends (whom I regard as morally good people) about this new information and the general response was “wow, that’s crazy.” and that’s where the conversation ended. Borderline lost, I turned to Rob and his passion again. I watched Revolution, his documentary that was released in-between the two Sharkwater films. Here, Rob realizes the problem stretches far beyond sharks. What’s the point of saving sharks, the animals that outlived dinosaurs, if the world’s fisheries and forests are projected to be depleted by 2048? If coral reefs, sustaining 25% of ocean life, are estimated to be dead no later than 2070? It’s wasn’t just about sharks anymore - it’s about saving everything, including ourselves.</p>
<p>Conservation is a tough sell. We tend to live our lives far removed from the destruction we create. Flushing our waste away and tossing out trash, never to be seen again. All day there are societal issues and public matters vying for our attention and money. Nobody wants to hear negative information about how we are trashing our planet because then our morals kick in and we feel the need to behave differently. Yet we’ve reached a cornerstone where conservation now means preservation of human life on earth. What information could be more important than that? There is nothing if we don’t have planet earth - Mars won’t be ready within the next 50 years.</p>
<p>I’m not going to pretend to be an environmental expert but here’s what I’ve learned. Ocean acidification, caused by enormous amounts of carbon dioxide emissions, is perhaps the most pressing threat. Oceans (which take up 90% of all habitable space on earth and house 80% of all species) absorb the vast majority of our emissions. In turn, due to increases in carbonic acid, anything that builds a skeleton (phytoplankton, fish, coral reefs, etc.) is subject to dissolution, eliminating keystone species and ecosystems, and greatly disrupting food chains. Bear in mind that oceans, starting with plankton, produce 50-70% of all oxygen on earth. Ocean acidity has increased by 30% since the Industrial Revolution. A small percentage of change in acidity in your body will kill you. This is a paradigm of exponential growth feeding off finite resources.</p>

<p>If you’re still with me thus far, there’s a chance I’ve struck a moral or spiritual chord inside of you. While the problem has never been more severe, there’s also never been a generation or a movement that cares more to save us. We’ve let our systems and corporations run rampant, along with our own consumption-centered mindsets. Remember that no matter how far removed our lives may be from the oceans, our decisions still affect them in profound ways. Be a conscious consumer by consuming less and in smarter ways. There’s enough plastic waste on earth that we never have to produce any more if we made use of what is already here. Every time you spend a dollar you’re voting for the kind of future you want based on who you’re giving that money to. Be mindful of what you eat by asking questions about whether it was sourced sustainably and by educating yourself. Pressure government and business leaders to implement and enforce policy that supports conservation. (U.S. general elections are in November, make sure you’re <a href="https://www.usa.gov/register-to-vote">registered to vote</a>!) Have conversations with your peers; when you know and understand what’s happening you feel morally compelled to act. Let’s bring nature back to the planet. It’s time to stop fighting against our problems and fight for a world that is beautiful for all humans and all species. Rob Stewart is my hero because time and time again he’s filled me with the purpose needed to make a change and inspire others.</p>
<p>January 31st, 2017. Rob Stewart went missing off the coast of Florida on a scuba diving expedition for Sharkwater Extinction, and three days later his body was recovered. It was an enormous loss for the community, and I cried - a lot. The Sharkwater team fulfilled Rob’s vision for the film and saw it through all the way to its world premiere at TIFF, where I sat and watched with a mix of emotions. Rob Stewart is still my hero for forever changing my world, but the part of his legacy that now resides within me means that it’s my duty to try to be a hero too. Sharkwater Extinction is currently touring film festivals across Canada, but will make its way into US theaters, <a href="https://www.sharkwater.com/">date TBD</a> - plan to go see it, it will change you. You can download Revolution <a href="http://therevolutionmovie.com/index.php/watch-the-movie/">here</a> for $3 through Vimeo. The original Sharkwater is harder to find, but Amazon still sells the DVD version <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sharkwater-Rob-Stewart/dp/B0013D8LHW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538029124&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sharkwater+rob+stewart">here.</a></p>
