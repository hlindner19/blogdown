      <description>Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a procedure performed for melanoma patients to check whether their melanoma has spread beyond their original tumor site. This information is used for determining an appropriate treatment plan and predicting long term outcomes for patients. However, there are subsets of patients who do not undergo SLNB for a variety reasons: the tumor is considered thin, the patient is elderly, the melanoma is already late stage, or the patient simply elects to not have the procedure.</description>
