      <description>Every time Iâ€™ve connected through the SeaTac airport I get a little salty about not being able to stay a while. Seattle had been a natural choice destination for about a year since the area underscores things I seek regularly: nature and sustainable living - plus it has the added benefits of a large city.</description>

      <description>Zion National Park had been at the top of my list for years and I finally made it there on a school spring break trip with a group of awesome randos. Zion exceeded all of my expectations, including how cold it is in March. This trip inspired me to make a goal to see as many National Parks as possible in my lifetime!</description>

      <description>One day I saw a picture of Banff and I thought it was really beautiful, so I googled whether there were any hostels in Banff, and if they have a public transit system. Both were a yes and the trip was born in under 10 minutes.</description>
