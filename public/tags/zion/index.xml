      <description>Zion National Park had been at the top of my list for years and I finally made it there on a school spring break trip with a group of randos. Zion exceeded all of my expectations, including how cold it is in March. This trip inspired me to make a goal to see as many National Parks as possible in my lifetime!</description>
