      <description>I wanted to return to Hawai’i this summer, but I specifically wanted to avoid Oahu and the tourist-developed atmosphere. Because of the volcano eruption on the Island of Hawai’i, and a lack of hostels that suited my needs in Maui, I decided on Kauai. This island has a completely different feel from Oahu; it’s more laid back, has a down-to-earth vibe, and is teeming with authentic culture.</description>

      <description>The trip that started them all. I had zero intentions of traveling to Hawaii. My goal was to get to Canada for a fishing trip, but after my flights fell a part I wasn’t going to be able to make it in time to meet up with my family to catch my ride to Canada.</description>
