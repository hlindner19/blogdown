      <description>Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a procedure performed for melanoma patients to check whether their melanoma has spread beyond their original tumor site. Such information is used for staging, determining a treatment plan and predicting long term outcomes for patients. There are however subsets of patients who do not undergo SLNB for various reasons: the tumor is considered thin, the patient is elderly, the melanoma is already late stage, or the patient elects to not have the procedure.</description>
