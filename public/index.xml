I discovered that research is really important and medicine is a fascinating field, so at some point I decided I should try to become an expert in Biostatistics.</description>

      <description>Growing up in a land-locked area, I had little exposure to the ocean and the creatures that call it home. So it was a bit unusual that I developed a deep-seeded love for the predator of the seas - sharks. The moment I looked past their media-driven reputation as ruthless killers, I discovered their worth. Having evolved over 400 million years ago, and surviving the last five mass extinctions, itâ€™s no wonder these animals are amazing super-predators, shaping all oceanic life and ecosystems since their arrival.</description>
