      <description>Growing up in a land-locked area, I had little exposure to the ocean and the creatures that call it home. So it was a bit unusual that I developed a deep-seeded love for the predator of the seas - sharks. The moment I looked past their media-driven reputation as ruthless killers, I discovered their worth. Having evolved over 400 million years ago, and surviving the last five mass extinctions, it’s no wonder these animals are amazing super-predators, shaping all oceanic life and ecosystems since their arrival.
In 2016 I stumbled upon a documentary on YouTube, called Sharkwater. Produced by Rob Stewart of Toronto Canada, it was an exposé on the shark fin industry. Over the years I had gotten the impression that sharks weren’t well respected. People treat sharks in ways that would ignite public outcry if the same actions were taken upon any land-dwelling animal, all in the name of fear and greed. But the scope of the problem was far beyond anything I had unearthed previously. Over 100 million sharks were being killed each year for the billion-dollar industry of shark fin soup (a Chinese delicacy), leading to a 90+% decline in shark populations. The impact of this on ocean ecosystems is nauseating.</description>
