      <description>Since immersing myself into the conservation world, I’ve tried to take every opportunity to learn more so that I can gain a better understanding of the problems we will face in our lifetimes. So with no idea of what to expect and minimal background knowledge on the energy industry, I attended the Wharton Energy Conference.</description>

      <description>Growing up in a land-locked area, I had little exposure to the ocean and the creatures that call it home. So it was a bit unusual that I developed a deep-seated love for the predator of the seas - sharks. The moment I looked past their media-driven reputation as ruthless killers, I discovered their worth.</description>

      <title>Kauai, Hawai&#39;i</title>

      <description>I wanted to return to Hawai’i this summer, but I specifically wanted to avoid Oahu and the tourist-developed atmosphere. Because of the volcano eruption on the Island of Hawai’i, and a lack of hostels that suited my needs in Maui, I decided on Kauai. This island has a completely different feel from Oahu; it’s more laid back, has a down-to-earth vibe, and is teeming with authentic culture.</description>

      <description>Zion National Park had been at the top of my list for years and I finally made it there on a school spring break trip with a group of awesome randos. Zion exceeded all of my expectations, including how cold it is in March. This trip inspired me to make a goal to see as many National Parks as possible in my lifetime!</description>

      <description>One day I saw a picture of Banff and I thought it was really beautiful, so I googled whether there were any hostels in Banff, and if they have a public transit system. Both were a yes and the trip was born in under 10 minutes.</description>

      <description>Salt Lake City was the final stop on what turned into the 2017 #summerofviews, and it did not disappoint. This city has a lively downtown area and quick access to outdoor adventure on every level, not to mention great public transit and a solid foodie scene - something for everybody!</description>

      <description>The trip that started them all. I had zero intentions of traveling to Hawaii. My goal was to get to Canada for a fishing trip, but after my flights fell a part I wasn’t going to be able to make it in time to meet up with my family to catch my ride to Canada.</description>
