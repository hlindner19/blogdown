            <p>More than once I’ve been asked to justify why I choose to do seemingly inconvenient things like carry my compost to school, eat vegan, and buy non-plastic products that are 3x the price of their plastic counterpart. Often my challengers want me to admit that my actions amount to buying us something like one-one trillionth more time on Earth, and that it’s pointless. And while they’re not wrong about ‘buying time’, they’ve failed to consider that such actions are less about myself and the big picture, and more about our counterparts on the receiving end.</p>
<p>When we consider making lifestyles changes for the sake of the environment, it’s typically ‘me-centric’. How inconvenient is this for <em>me</em>? How much more will it cost <em>me</em>? How much of <em>my</em> time does it take? Where do <em>I</em> benefit? Despite the focus on ‘me’, the reality is that as a white, middle-class person living in Philadelphia, I likely won’t experience neither the fruits of my actions, nor the vast majority of the catastrophic effects of climate change in my lifetime. Undoubtedly the latter is most experienced by the impoverished, the minorities, the poor, the under-represented, the indigenous, the oppressed.</p>
<p>While my actions may have initially risen out of wanting to fight the climate crisis and to feel good about my choices, it has taken on new life in the form of environmental justice and climate justice. The aforementioned people are constantly at odds with systems that don’t work for them - against them, really. It’s almost cool these days to be <em>that</em> environmentally conscious person; frankly I think it’s ‘cooler’ to be the person who makes a lifestyle change, or tries to push policy, that aligns with these community’s environmental goals. It is <strong>so</strong> (<strong>SO</strong>) important to understand how our systems need to change <em>in conjunction</em> with those currently getting the short end of the stick, lest we fuck it up again and again, pushing the needle in ways that continue to work against their basic needs.</p>
<p>Two examples that shifted my perspective:</p>

<p>The keynote speaker for the Student’s for Zero Waste 2018 conference was grassroots activist, Melissa Miles who lives in the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey. The Ironbound is an environmental justice community, due to heavy amounts of pollution from industrial factories, a massive garbage incinerator, and being home to a former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange">Agent Orange</a> dioxin factory. Further, an important characteristic of the Ironbound is that it is a multi-ethnic, largely working-class community, where 1 out of every 4 residents live in poverty.</p>
<p>The keynote focused on the negative impacts of the incinerator that operates in her community. It’s an exceptional example of a broken system. First, we must recognize the function of an incinerator. Waste not going to landfill may be taken to an incinerator where it is burned to ash. In turn, flue gas and heat are expelled. Let’s be clear… Burning trash does <strong>not</strong> make it disappear (…think First Law of Thermodynamics…). What it does do, however, is release particulate matter and other toxins into the atmosphere that are inhaled day in and day out by the Ironbound residents, resulting in documented increases in respiratory-related illnesses and diseases. It also destroys goods that someone deemed to be waste, but could have otherwise been mined as a resource for reuse.</p>
<p>Incinerators require massive amounts of waste to churn a profit and continue operating. Thus, owners and those investing in incinerators (also extremely costly to build and maintain) are inherently condoning and encouraging greater amounts of consumption (hello capitalism) resulting in more waste <em>despite</em> the harmful byproduct effects it has on: 1. the health of resident communities where incinerators operate and 2. the health of our speck of space dust.</p>
<p><strong>Historically, incinerators have been placed in <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/11/115008#erl521204s2">low-income neighborhoods of color</a>, leaving already vulnerable communities to bear the burden of everybody else’s waste.</strong></p>

<p>The Enbridge Line 3 crude oil replacement project is one of many big oil projects underway in the States. Line 3 runs from Alberta Canada, through North Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, and is currently running at limited capacity due to corroding equipment, hence the replacement project. Since being proposed in 2014, construction has been approved in Canada, ND, and WI, but has been met with resistance in Minnesota over environmental and indigenous concerns.</p>
<p>To call it a replacement project is misleading. Ultimately Enbridge seeks to abandon much of the present Line 3 in MN, leaving it to further corrode underground, and reroute the line. Of particular concern is where they wish to reroute. The proposal passes through Ojibwe Treaty Land, which contains hundreds of miles of wetlands and wild rice beds, sacred to the indigenous of Northern MN. Pipelines are not a question of whether they will leak, but when. (Enbridge wears the badge for one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamazoo_River_oil_spill">largest inland oil spill in the US</a>). In doing so, they pose a threat to the natural and cultural resources, which violates treaty rights of the Anishinaabeg established in the mid 1800s.</p>
<p>In historical fashion, the MN public utilities committee (PUC) has repeatedly <a href="https://www.stopline3.org/news/tribalpetition">silenced and dismissed</a> the voices of the affected tribes, forging onward with the permitting process, ultimately (and unsurprisingly) <a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/energy-and-mining/4586403-dnr-opens-comment-period-enbridge-line-3-license-and-permit">approving Enbridge’s permits</a> last June. Construction is slated to begin in the latter half of 2020, pending permit approval from the MN Pollution Control Agency, Department of Natural Resources, and water a crossing permit from the Army Corps of Engineers. Environmental groups, local tribes, and the state Department of Commerce continue to fight via court appeals. Assuming (against hope) that oil reigns king, it is certainly not me, nor my MN family and friends living in the vicinity that will feel the ripples of Enbridge’s agenda. It’s the Fond du Lac Band, whose reservation land is directly disturbed by the reroute, and the neighboring Bands (White Earth, Leech Lake, Red Lake, Mille Lacs) of the Chippewa and Ojibwe Indians whose treaty land is affected, that are made to sacrifice the land they hold most sacred in the name of oil. Big Greed and Big Money seek to take back what little we left for those here before us; <strong>this is modern-day colonialism.</strong></p>
<p>(A small token of hope: The MN Court of Appeals <a href="http://m.startribune.com/appeals-court-said-environmental-impact-statement-enbridge-pipeline-inadequate/510760822/">just reversed</a> a (favorable for Enbridge) ruling by state utility regulators regarding the environmental impact statement for Line 3.)</p>
<p>So to the challengers of seemingly small actions, remember that every enviornmental problem is also a justice problem. Small things can be profound for those who live in lack. In return, I ask you: <strong>With whom, and how, do you align yourself so that you do not become a part of historical and systematic oppression?</strong></p>

I want to acknowledge the past, present, and future generations of the Native Nations who formerly occupied Lenapehoking, where so-called present-day Philadelphia resides. Most Lenape Indians were pushed from the area due to European colonization in the early 1800s, and ultimately removed under the Indian Removal Act in the 1860s by the US government.
