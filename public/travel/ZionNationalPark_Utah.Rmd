Zion National Park had been at the top of my list for years and I finally made it there on a school spring break trip with a group of randos. Zion exceeded all of my expectations, including how cold it is in March. This trip inspired me to make a goal to see as many National Parks as possible in my lifetime!

Camp! Zion has three [campgrounds](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/campgrounds-in-zion.htm) that are open March-November: Watchman, South, and Lava Point. I stayed at Watchman. If you plan to camp, you should make a reservation online as soon as reservations open up as they go fast.  
**Highlights:**  Watchman and South are adjacently located next to the South Entrance which means you have immediate access to [Zion Outfitter](https://www.zionoutfitter.com), (clothing, equipment rental, and SHOWERS!/laundry), the Zion Canyon Visitor Center, Brew Pub, a small grocery/supply story, and a gift store. (Talk about luxurious camping options). The campsites also have fully functioning restrooms, potable water, and trash dumpsters. The star gazing at night from camp is spectacular.  
**Downsides:** Cell phone reception is too good here.  
**Price:** Tent-only campsites are $20/night.

**HOW TO GET AROUND**
</font>
</center>

A rental car here is a necessity (mostly to get to the park, and to get around during the off-season). If you are visiting during the busy season (March - November), you cannot drive through the canyon on Zion Canyon Scenic Dive, you must use the [free park shuttle](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/shuttle-system.htm) which leaves from Zion Canyon Visitor Center and stops at every trail along the route. Upon entering the park, you have to purchase a park pass if you don't have an annual for \$35, valid for seven days.

**Valley of Fire:** On the first night of camping, it was so cold in Zion Canyon that we instead decided to camp in the aptly named [Valley of Fire State Park](http://parks.nv.gov/parks/valley-of-fire) in Nevada, which is on the way from Las Vegas to ZNP. Since we were there anyways, we spent the following day doing various short hikes through the park, including the Wall of Fire. Many of these hikes are marked with petroglyphs dating back more than 2,000 years; my personal favorite being Mystical Bat Woman. The park entrance fee is \$10 and camping is \$20/night.

**Angel's Landing:** Angel's landing is the quintessential Zion hike, which is why it is so crowded *all* the time. Getting to the trail head (The Grotto) as early as possible is highly encouraged. This 4.1 mile (6.6 km) hike can be broken into two pieces. First, you ascend 'Walters Wiggles', a series of 21 steep switchbacks covering 1.5 miles that take you to the first observation point. If you don't want to continue onto 'the chains' (though I highly recommend you do) this is where you stop. The chains portion covers an additional half-mile alone the ridge line, with drops to the canyon floor on either side. Support chains are secured into the rock in sketchier areas. The trail is so narrow in most places that you are hiking in a single-file line behind herds of other hikers. There's usually a handful of petrified people so the going can be slow. With a grippy pair of shoes and your whits about you, there's little to fear though. First-time hikers, children, and senior people complete this regularly with no problems. The views of the canyon from the final lookout are spectacular and worth the extra work!

Literally anything you can cook on a fire, including pizza with dried pineapple, because pineapple *always* goes on pizza.
