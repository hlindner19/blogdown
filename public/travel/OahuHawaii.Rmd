The trip that started them all. I had zero intentions of traveling to Hawaii. My goal was to get to Canada for a fishing trip, but after my flights fell a part I wasn't going to be able to make it in time to meet up with my family to catch my ride to Canada. I didn't take vacation days for nothing... so I switched my flight to Honolulu during my layover. The only downside: the type of things you pack for Canada versus Hawai'i are very different.

[Seaside Hawaiian Hostel](http://seasidehawaiianhostel.com/) resides in the heart of Waikiki, only an 8 minute walk to Waikiki beach. The 19 or 20 bus (departing from the upper level of the airport) will take you nearly to the doorstep of the hostel.  
**Highlights:** Staff provided cheap breakfast options like pastries and muffins. The outdoor space is equipped with a hot tub, shower/hose for rinsing off, and a spot to watch movies. Lockers are available within the dorms (BYO lock, of course) and laundry is available for a fee. The biggest advantage is the central location to beaches, shops and restaurants.  
**Downsides:** Everyone I know who has stayed here agrees that it is rather loud at night, in both the common areas and bedrooms. Ants galore; they're not playing when they say not to bring any food in the dorms. The overall atmosphere was mediocre - not the friendliest of places I have stayed.     
**Price:** $32/night for a 6-bed coed dorm

Since I hadn't planned on taking a vacation, my budget was rather limited. To cut costs, I avoided renting a car and utilized the local bus system, Uber/Lyft, and took up offers from other hostel dwellers to go exploring. Coming from a city where the bus system is semi-functional on a good day, Oahu's ['TheBus'](http://thebus.org) was a real treat. You can download their app, DaBus2, for real-time tracking. Route 22 will take you to several tourist hot spots including Diamond Head, Hanauma Bay and Koko Crater. Reach the North Shore via the 52, and get between Waikiki and HNL airport on route 19 or 20. You can nearly circumnavigate the island using the bus system. One-way fare is $2.75.

**Diamond Head Hike:** Undoubtedly the most popular hike in the area, the historic Diamond Head State Monument hike is roughly a 2 mile (3.2 km) round trip hike, only 3 miles from the hostel (can take bus route 2 or 23 + 15 min walk to the trail head). It takes you up a series of steep switchbacks and staircases to the old fire control station, providing great views of the surrounding Waikiki area. Arrive very early as there's always a crowd, and because there is very little shade on the trail. (Like so crowded the trail looks like an ant farm from afar). Be prepared to pay the entrance fee (cash only) of \$1 as a walk-in or \$5 to drive in. Bring a few extra dollars for fresh pineapple on your way out!

**Manoa Falls Hike:**  Take a break from the sun and hit the Manoa Falls trail, located in the rain forest of the Manoa Valley. It's relatively short, only 1.6 miles (2.5 km) to the lower 150 foot waterfall (which I recommend taking a dip in when you arrive - it's refreshingly cold, and slightly frowned upon). I opted to go on a guided hike here through [Hiking Hawaii](hikinghawaii808.com), mostly for the convenience of the included transportation. The added bonus was that I had a cool, knowledgeable local to teach me things about the rain forest. The guide groups are small, no more than 7 hikers and offer the opportunity to meet other people. Hiking Hawaii also has a hip cafe in Waikiki to swing by for a bite to eat. The trail itself is quite muddy (duh, it's the rain forest), so reasonable footwear is important.

**Koko Head Crater Hike:**  Koko Crater is a very popular, real life StairMaster and not for the faint of heart! The 1.8 mile (2.9 km) out-and-back takes you up 1,050 'stairs', which are actually old and decrepit railroad ties that were once used to get supplies up to the peak, where you will find military bunkers that were built during WWII. Sturdy footwear is essential as there are some pretty sketchy areas, including a bridge of railroad ties with a 40 foot drop underneath. Rest often and step off to the side to let other hikers pass you. If you love leg day, this is your hike. Take the 22 bus from Waikiki and get off at Kalanianaole Hwy + Hanauma Bay Rd. Follow the trail to the base of Koko Head. (Also go down to Hanauma Bay across the street afterwards for some much earned beach bumming and snorkeling).

**Cruise the Island:** To really get a feel for Oahu, find yourself a car, or someone who has a car and start driving the coast. There are plenty of scenic stops along the way to make an entire day out of it, whether you travel to the west most point of the island or head up the North Shore. Chat with the locals along the way and let them guide you to the best hole-in-the-wall stops along the way. (This is how Aloha Poke was discovered). Electric beach is a fun stop for snorkeling if going west, but note that the current can be strong here. Also if going west, drive to where the road ends and make the two-mile hike to Kaena point and watch the sunset from the westward most point of the island.

**Magic Island:** If Waikiki beach is a bit too crowded for your taste, hop on the 8, 19, or 42 bus and cruise over to Magic Island Lagoon at Ala Moana Beach Park. If you're as lucky as I was, you'll have the whole place basically to yourself! There's a nice park behind the lagoon too.

**Aloha Poke:**  A hole-in-the-wall type place in Waianae, [Aloha Poke](https://www.facebook.com/AlohaPoke1/) will fulfill all your fresh fish dreams and let you experience the local cuisine. Parking is sparse but don't let that deter you, this place gets rave reviews!

**Island Vintage Shave Ice:** This popular spot located at the Royal Hawaiian Center next to Waikiki Beach has the best shave ice I have encountered. It's made with natural ingredients rather than syrups and is garnished with fresh fruits, popping boba, and mochi. The line is always long but definitely worth the wait after a tiring day.
