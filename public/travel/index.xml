      <description>Don’t look like a serial killer. Arm out. Thumb up. Higher… Like you know what you’re doing! Ass hole… don’t look at me like that. Nobody is going to stop if your thumb ain’t got enough confidence. That website definitely lied. Wooowww okay just keep driving with all that spare room you got in your car.</description>

      <description>If you’re drawing a blank when you read ‘Faroe Islands’, you’re likely not alone. I drew a near-complete blank when the email rolled in notifying me that airfare had plummeted. It didn’t take more than ten minutes of research to know that I wanted to go, and an hour of high-level planning to believe it was feasible to do economically.</description>

      <description>Sweden isn’t your typical spring break destination, but a combination of cheap flights and curiosity about my roots convinced me to visit during their off-season. The trip was slightly unusual for me in that the draw to location wasn’t tied to a landscape and related activities.</description>

      <description>Everybody has a list. A bucket list, travel list, a hit list (jk). Something special holds the top spot, something that makes you more excited and giddy than every other option. For years, South Africa has held that spot on my list. Despite constant eagerness, this trip just wasn’t in the cards until recently, and I think it worked out for the best.</description>

      <description>Every time I’ve connected through the SeaTac airport I get a little salty about not being able to stay a while. Seattle had been a natural choice destination for about a year since the area underscores things I seek regularly: nature and sustainable living - plus it has the added benefits of a large city.</description>

      <title>Kauai, Hawai&#39;i</title>

      <description>I wanted to return to Hawai’i this summer, but I specifically wanted to avoid Oahu and the tourist-developed atmosphere. Because of the volcano eruption on the Island of Hawai’i, and a lack of hostels that suited my needs in Maui, I decided on Kauai. This island has a completely different feel from Oahu; it’s more laid back, has a down-to-earth vibe, and is teeming with authentic culture.</description>

      <description>Zion National Park had been at the top of my list for years and I finally made it there on a school spring break trip with a group of awesome randos. Zion exceeded all of my expectations, including how cold it is in March. This trip inspired me to make a goal to see as many National Parks as possible in my lifetime!</description>

      <description>One day I saw a picture of Banff and I thought it was really beautiful, so I googled whether there were any hostels in Banff, and if they have a public transit system. Both were a yes and the trip was born in under 10 minutes.</description>

      <description>Salt Lake City was the final stop on what turned into the 2017 #summerofviews, and it did not disappoint. This city has a lively downtown area and quick access to outdoor adventure on every level, not to mention great public transit and a solid foodie scene - something for everybody!</description>

      <description>The trip that started them all. I had zero intentions of traveling to Hawaii. My goal was to get to Canada for a fishing trip, but after my flights fell a part I wasn’t going to be able to make it in time to meet up with my family to catch my ride to Canada.</description>
